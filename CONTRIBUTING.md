# Contributors Guidelines

Contributions to py3minepi are welcome! Please adhere to the following
contribution guidelines though:

- Please follow the [coding
  guidelines](https://github.com/py3minepi/py3minepi#coding-guidelines).
- Use meaningful commit messages: First line of your commit message should be a
  very short summary (ideally 50 characters or less). After the first line of
  the commit message, add a blank line and then a more detailed explanation (when
  relevant).  [This](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
  is a nice blog post concerning git commit messages.
- Add yourself to the [AUTHORS.txt
  file](https://github.com/py3minepi/py3minepi/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt).
- Even if you have write access to the repository, never push commits directly
  to master. Always create a branch or a fork and post a pull request. The pull
  request will then be merged by someone other than you after at least 1
  approving comment by a py3minepi organization member.

If you want to make sure that your changes didn't break anything, you may also
run the [test suite](https://github.com/py3minepi/py3minepi#testing) before
committing and pushing your changes. (If you don't, the changes will still be
automatically tested though on Travis CI.)

Thanks for your contribution!
